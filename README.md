# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Movie Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“– Introduction

Netflix has become one of the most popular streaming platforms, offering thousands of movies and shows across different genres. With such a huge collection, it is important to study the data to understand what kind of movies are most common, which genres are liked the most, and how movie popularity changes over time.

In this project, I have worked on a dataset of nearly **9,838 Netflix movies**. The goal is to analyze the data and find answers to some interesting questions like: Which genre is most frequent? Which movie is the most popular? Which year had the highest number of movies filmed?

By doing this analysis, the project highlights important trends in Netflix movies that can help in understanding audience preferences and overall movie patterns on the platform.
